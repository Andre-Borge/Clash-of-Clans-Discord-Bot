# general
- add a status report every x amount of x
- clear command
- auto delete last report(edit command can also work here) (working on this currently)✅. Done for now until i further develop it
- clan war pings every 6? hours
- some kind of sync system using user api


# bugs
- bot status not working✅
- changed a annoying "bug" where /clear would print a bunch of errors, due to limit=amount + 1 also deletes /clear message, which then made followup message bug out
